# Sistine

Sistine and Kiruya was supposed to be the project I stuck with through High School. Unfortunately, life did not want it that way and since then every time I thought about or tried to work on this project, I begin to remember unsightly things and I end up not wanting to work on this. 

Because of this, I just decided to start the project `Eternity` to create a sustainable bot that requires no VPS to run. All it does is run on local hardware efficiently and presentable.

Check out https://github.com/Kashalls for updates on Eternity.
