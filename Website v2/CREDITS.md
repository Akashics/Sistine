I have to say, to everyone who's helped me on what was once just a "me" project, thank you for putting up with a stubborn kid who didn't have a single clue what he was doing, but ended up making something he thinks was worth his time. Now this list of people is not limited to just the people on the list, if your not here, just dm this user: `201077739589992448` on discord, chances are you know who that is. 

**Everyone at the Discord.JS Official Guild**: `Helped me avoid answering my question when I asked, still got a few answers though. :)`

**York and Evie**: `God dang, I can't say how much you guys have inspired me to code, y'all made it look easy on the tutorials. Thanks for the help and I look forward to working with y'all in the future.`

**Adidos (AdityaTD) and QuantumnlyTangled**: `Thanks for putting up with me, you all need be online more my timezone though.`

**GodsAperture and the Christians of Graal**: `Thanks for literally everything, and the communion of opinions. Probably my biggest supporters. `

**Jacz**: `Everything is modular. Get over it.`

**Tanner and Havana Bot**: `You gave me some support when I needed it most (expesscially during my database disaster). I still owe you one! (Expires never )`

**Discord Bot List and the Discord API**: `Y'all have some fun people to talk with. That's about it.`

**Kyra**: `I still can't pronounce your name correctly according to Quantum. I graduated from spoonfeeding to tried to fix it and then begged for help.`

**AoDude**: `You still don't read your DM's or you never reply.`
